# Generative Design Work

## Grid based compuational visual art
Based around the concept of creating art via predefined "rules", we consider how visuals are created. All artwork allows desicions to be made in their creation, this way 'forces' me to make these prior to
the creation.

Inspired by Serbian artist, Aleksandra JovaniÄ‡. 
This algorithm creates a piece based around such rules. A canvas is divided into spaces, we apply a noise field over the canvas and then formulate rules as to how to draw a set of lines within that space.

The appearance becomes fluid, organic yet tinged with order. Like woven muscle fibres, strands of hair, crumpled paper.

By allowing some spaces to appear vacant we are reminded of the natural process of decay, of holes in 'perfection'. Without the white spaces we cannot fully appreciate the beauty of dark lines.
